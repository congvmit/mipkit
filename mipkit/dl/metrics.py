    r"""Computes Pearson Correlation Coefficient across rows.
    Pearson Correlation Coefficient (also known as Linear Correlation
    Coefficient or Pearson's :math:`\rho`) is computed as:
    .. math::
        \rho = \frac {E[(X-\mu_X)(Y-\mu_Y)]} {\sigma_X\sigma_Y}
    If inputs are matrices, then then we assume that we are given a
    mini-batch of sequences, and the correlation coefficient is
    computed for each sequence independently and returned as a vector. If
    `batch_fist` is `True`, then we assume that every row represents a
    sequence in the mini-batch, otherwise we assume that batch information
    is in the columns.
    Warning:
        We do not account for the multi-dimensional case. This function has
        been tested only for the 2D case, either in `batch_first==True` or in
        `batch_first==False` mode. In the multi-dimensional case,
        it is possible that the values returned will be meaningless.
    Args:
        x (torch.Tensor): input tensor
        y (torch.Tensor): target tensor
        batch_first (bool, optional): controls if batch dimension is first.
            Default: `True`
    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: correlation coefficient between `x` and `y`
    Note:
        :math:`\sigma_X` is computed using **PyTorch** builtin
        **Tensor.std()**, which by default uses Bessel correction:
        .. math::
            \sigma_X=\displaystyle\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^N({x_i}-\bar{x})^2
        We therefore account for this correction in the computation of the
        covariance by multiplying it with :math:`\frac{1}{N-1}`.
    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, M)` for correlation between matrices,
          or :math:`(M)` for correlation between vectors
        - Target: :math:`(N, M)` or :math:`(M)`. Must be identical to input
        - Output: :math:`(N, 1)` for correlation between matrices,
          or :math:`(1)` for correlation between vectors
    Examples:
        >>> import torch
        >>> _ = torch.manual_seed(0)
        >>> input = torch.rand(3, 5)
        >>> target = torch.rand(3, 5)
        >>> output = pearsonr(input, target)
        >>> print('Pearson Correlation between input and target is {0}'.format(output[:, 0]))
        Pearson Correlation between input and target is tensor([ 0.2991, -0.8471,  0.9138])
